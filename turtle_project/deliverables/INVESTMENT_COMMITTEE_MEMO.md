⚠️ **Technical analysis maintains predictive power**  

### Risk Matrix

| **Risk Factor** | **Probability** | **Impact** | **Mitigation** |
|----------------|----------------|------------|----------------|
| **Model Decay** | High | Medium | Monthly retraining |
| **Regime Change** | Medium | High | Ensemble models, regime detection |
| **Liquidity Crisis** | Low | High | Position limits, diversification |
| **Technology Failure** | Low | Medium | Backup systems |

### Risk Controls
- **Daily loss limit**: 2% of portfolio value
- **Position limits**: 5% per asset, 20% per sector
- **Real-time monitoring**: Automated alerts and controls
- **Monthly validation**: Model retraining and performance review
