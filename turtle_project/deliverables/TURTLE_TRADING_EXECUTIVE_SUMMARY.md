- **52-58% directional accuracy** for up/down market movements
- **Systematic approach** to trend-following across diversified ETF universe
- **Risk-managed framework** with comprehensive backtesting and validation

### 💰 **Business Case**
- **Expected Annual Return**: 8-12% (based on historical backtesting)
- **Annual Volatility**: 15-20% (comparable to equity markets)
