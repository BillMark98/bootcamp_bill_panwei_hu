# Stakeholder Summary

**Objective:** Minimal, handoff-ready productization pipeline.

**Result:** Model trained, pickled, served via Flask API (with simple validation) and a plot endpoint.

**Assumptions:** Linear baseline suffices for demo.

**Risks:** No auth; minimal error handling.

**Next Steps:** Add tests, logging, auth; containerize; CI/CD.
