        "We aim to determine whether the classic **Turtle Trading** (breakout trend-following) rules generate **robust, net-of-cost** excess returns in current markets. The core question: *Does a Donchian-channel breakout system with risk-based position sizing still deliver attractive risk-adjusted performance after realistic costs and modern competition, or has the edge been arbitraged away?*\n",
        "\n",
        "The study will replicate and modernize the Turtle approach across a diversified, liquid multi-asset universe (e.g., major futures/FX or ETF proxies), evaluate performance from the early 2000s through 2025, and stress-test stability across market regimes (pre/post-2008, QE/ZIRP, COVID, 2022–2023 inflationary regime, 2024–2025). Outcomes will inform a **go / modify / no-go** decision for deploying a trend-following sleeve.\n",

        "- **End users:** \n",
        "  - **Quant researcher** (builds data pipeline/backtests, reports results).\n",
        "  - **Risk manager** (assesses drawdowns, correlation to existing book, tail risk).\n",
        "- **Workflow context & timing:** Initial research sprint (1–2 weeks of prototyping), followed by validation and a small paper-trade phase before any live deployment.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Useful Answer & Decision\n",
        "- **Type of answer:** Primarily **descriptive** (historical performance) with **predictive lean** via walk-forward and regime analysis; no causal identification required.\n",
        "- **Decision framing:** \n",
        "  - **GO** if the strategy shows **out-of-sample** and **recent-period** net Sharpe above threshold, controlled drawdowns, and low correlation to existing exposures.  \n",
        "  - **MODIFY** if edge exists but is parameter-sensitive, capacity-limited, or overly cyclical.  \n",

        "- **Data availability:** Daily (or higher) prices for a diversified, liquid set of futures (or ETF proxies if futures not available). Continuous futures with transparent **roll methodology** (back-adjusted or panama-adjusted). FX spot/rolling futures where applicable.\n",
        "- **Trading frictions:** Commission + fees + **slippage**; model as (a) % of price for ETFs or (b) **ticks** for futures. Include spreads and conservative impact for fast markets.\n",
        "- **Execution model:** End-of-day signals; next-day open or close execution; no leverage beyond policy (e.g., risk parity scaling within margin limits).\n",
        "- **Risk constraints:** Unit risk via **ATR-based** position sizing; per-instrument and portfolio-level risk caps; diversification across asset classes.\n",
        "- **Compliance:** Research-only; no live trading implied; adhere to data licenses.\n",

        "- **Overfitting & multiple testing:** Parameter sweeps inflate false positives; control with **walk-forward**, **nested CV**, and **reality checks**.\n",
        "- **Cost mis-estimation:** Understated slippage/spreads can turn gross edge into net loss.\n",
        "- **Roll & contract selection:** Different continuous futures methods materially change PnL.\n",

        "- **Robustness:** Consistent performance across parameter grids (e.g., 20/55 and neighbors), instruments, and regimes; limited degradation under higher slippage.\n",
        "- **Stability:** Out-of-sample (holdout / walk-forward) maintains **SR ≥ 0.4–0.5** with similar drawdown/risk profile.\n",

        "  2. Implement baseline Turtle rules; verify against known references on a small subset.\n",
        "  3. **Parameter sweeps** with proper train/validation splits; **walk-forward** evaluation.\n",
        "  4. **Cost sensitivity** analysis; stress tests (gaps, volatility clusters, thin liquidity days).\n",
        "  5. **Attribution:** by asset, asset-class, regime; correlation to major risk premia.\n",
